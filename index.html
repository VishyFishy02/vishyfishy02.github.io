        <h2>📜 What you should know about me:</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a recent grad of Ohio State, where I majored in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in AI. 
        </p>

        <p>
          But I’m interested in lots of other things outside of Computer Science like learning theory, and educational platforms like Khan Academy and 3Blue1Brown. I’m fascinated by the methodologies which get people to learn just outside of their comfort zone, but not so uncomfortable to make them feel overwhelmed and quit.

        <h2>📜 Currently I'm:</h2>
        <p>
          Teaching english and programming in Taiwan as a Fulbright Scholar. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In New Taipei I hope to live genuinely on my own, be a warm teacher for my students, and nurture experiences and relationships to pluck into my worldview basket.
        </p>
        <p>
          They’ll make for ample ingredients as I strive to create platforms that empower people to be more curious about the world and bring their own ideas to life.

        <h2>🔮I’m really curious about:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Are new ideas really new? How can we systematically explore non-adjacent fields to stumble upon stupidly great ideas?</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Creative Writing. How cool would it be to write clearly about my own ideas, and craft sentences to bridge the unexaplaiable, yet deeply understood voids that exist between people? </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Architecture and Interior design. It's interesting how spaces can shape social interactions and the effect they have on your mood. My personal preference is white walls and warm woods, with pops of colour and clean, geometric lines. </li>
        </ul>
