          <h3>AmpleGCG-Plus</h3>
          <p>AmpleGCG-Plus is a suite of LLMs fine-tuned for 'jailbreaking' other LLMs. We ran the GCG jailbreaking algorithm against numerous victim models, and then trained a suite of LLMs to approximate the discrete optimization algorithm given any harmful query. <br><br> Use AmpleGCG-Plus to see if your models are robust to OOD adversarial prompts. </p>

          <h3>Harmony</h3>
          <p>A song recommender system that translates vague feelings into music suggestions. I fine-tuned Gemini to convert natural language mood descriptions into Elasticsearch queries using Spotify API song parameters. The frontend was built out with React/Next.js, and multiple APIs to connect user accounts and visualize songs. <br><br> Harmony was featured in the College of Engineering's Capstone Showcase.</p>

          <p>A reccomendation engine to help newbies navigate the wine market. Somm uses RAG, Cohere Rerank, and GPT-4 to convert flavor descriptions to desired wines and wine styles. I built the pipeline with LangChain and deployed the model with Shiny. <br><br> Somm won a top project award in a cohort of 500+ PhD students at the Erdos Institute Data Science Bootcamp.</p>
