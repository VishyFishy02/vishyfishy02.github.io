        <h2>üìú What you should know about me:</h2>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm a fourth year Computer Science and Engineering student at Ohio State with a specialization in AI. I am also a 21st year student in life, and I hope to never stop learning as I strive to create platforms that empower others to be more curious about the world and bring their ideas to life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aside from my major, I‚Äôm interested in lots of other things, especially learning theory, and educational platforms like Khan Academy, 3Blue1Brown, and Minecraft Education. I‚Äôm fascinated by the methodologies which get people to operate just at the edge of their knowledge, yet not so far out as to make them feel overwhelmed and quit. 
        </p>

        <h2>üîÆI‚Äôm really curious about:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Travel and living abroad. I think solo-living abroad would foster a lot of personal growth-- much different from traveling with family. You would have to learn how to take care of yourself well, form new relationships in a different country, and maybe learn more about yourself in the process. Plus it would be fun to have lots of solo adventures. </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Creative Writing. Although I'm not as well-read as I'd like to be (something I'm actively working on), I've recently found myself captivated by great essays. I love the ones that leave me in the lingering haze of their impact. How cool would it be to write clearly about my own ideas, and maybe even give the same feeling to others? </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Architecture and Interior design. It's interesting how spaces can shape social interactions and the effect they have on your mood. My personal preference is white walls and warm woods, with pops of colour and clean, geometric lines. </li>
        </ul>
