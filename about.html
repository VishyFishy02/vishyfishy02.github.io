        <p>
          I am a computer scientist, teacher, and recent graduate of Ohio State University, where I majored in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in AI. 
          <br><br>
          Currently, I'm living and teaching in New Taipei City, Taiwan, as a Fulbright Scholar. I'm also involved in ongoing NLP and education research projects at Carnegie Mellon and Ohio State.   
          <br><br>
          Prior to my Fulbright, I have worked as a software engineer, an ESL teacher, and (one of my favorite jobs) a kayaking instructor. See my works page for a curated list of projects across AI, software development, and education.

        <p>
          Teaching english and programming in Taiwan as a Fulbright Scholar. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In New Taipei I hope to live genuinely on my own, be a warm teacher for my students, and nurture experiences and relationships to pluck into my worldview basket.
        </p>
        <p>
          They‚Äôll make for ample ingredients as I strive to create platforms that empower people to be more curious about the world and bring their own ideas to life.

        <h2>üîÆI‚Äôm really curious about:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Are new ideas really new? How can we systematically explore non-adjacent fields to stumble upon stupidly great ideas?</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Creative Writing. How cool would it be to write clearly about my own ideas, and craft sentences to bridge the unexaplaiable, yet deeply understood voids that exist between people? </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Architecture and Interior design. It's interesting how spaces can shape social interactions and the effect they have on your mood. My personal preference is white walls and warm woods, with pops of colour and clean, geometric lines. </li>
