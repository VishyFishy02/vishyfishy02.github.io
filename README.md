Hi, this is the repo for my personal website

Ideas:

-- add sound: ambient maybe?
-- connect it to a streaming service api, where I can make a playlist on my phone and have that be the queue
of songs for the website

-- add more objects? maybe change the torus ring for a cool spinning chandeleir or something?
